Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

approach : unorderedmap, multimap

public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        unordered_map<char,int>mp;
        multimap<int,char>mr;
        string result="";
        for(auto i : s){
            mp[i]++;
        }
        for(auto i : mp){
            mr.insert({i.second,i.first});
        }
        for(auto it=mr.rbegin();it!=mr.rend();++it){
           result += string(it->first,it->second);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
